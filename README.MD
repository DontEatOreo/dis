dis is a simple and fast tool to compress videos for Discord and other platforms. It uses [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to download and process videos from various sources, such as YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, and more.

I created this project to make smaller videos that load faster for everyone and are more easily shareable on Discord and other platforms.

## Installation

To install **dis** ðŸŽ¥, you need to have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) installed on your system. You can download them from their official websites or use your package manager of choice.

You can then download the latest release of **dis** ðŸŽ¥ from the [Releases](https://github.com/DontEatOreo/dis/releases) tab on GitHub. Alternatively, you can clone this repository and build the project yourself using [dotnet publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish).

## Usage

To use **dis** ðŸŽ¥, you need to provide an input video source using the `-i` (`--input`) option. The input source can be either a local file or an online URL (e.g: Discord Server, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc...).

You can also specify various options to customize the output video, such as:

| Option                                          | Description                                                                                            | Default Value |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `-rd`, `-rn`, `-rnd`, `--random`                | Randomize the output filename                                                                          | `False`       |
| `-c`, `--crf` <crf>                             | Constant Rate Factor (CRF) value for video compression                                                 | `29`          |
| `-r`, `--resolution` <resolution>               | Output video resolution                                                                                | None          |
| `-a`, `-ab`, `--audio-bitrate` <audio-bitrate>  | Output audio bitrate                                                                                   | `128k`        |
| `-k`, `-kw`, `-kwm`, `--keep`                   | Keep the watermark on the output video                                                                 | `False`       |
| `-sb`, `-sponsorblock`                          | Remove the sponsor segments from the output video using [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) API  | `False`       |
| `-vc`, `--codec`, `--video-codec` <video-codec> | Output video codec                                                                                     | None          |
| `-t`, `--trim` <trim>                           | Trim the input video/audio from a specific start and end time (in seconds) using the format: start-end | None          |

The CRF is a video compression method that grants users control over the output video's quality, with higher values resulting in lower quality and vice versa. It is recommended to avoid values below 22 or above 38.

Here are some examples of how to use **dis** ðŸŽ¥:

Compressing a video sourced from an online location:

```bash
dis -i https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/x/x/video.webm
```

Compressing a local file while adjusting its resolution to `480p` and saving it to a designated directory:

```bash
dis -i video.webm -r 480p -o /home/user/Downloads
```

Compressing a video from YouTube and change the video codec to `h265`, resolution to `720p`, and audio bitrate to `128`, with a custom CRF value:

```bash
dis -i https://youtu.be/xxxxxxx -vc h265 -r 720p -ab 128 -c 20
```

Compressing a video from YouTube and trimming only a 60 seconds period of time.

```bash
dis -i https://youtu.be/xxxxxxx -t 50-110
```
